>All of these can be found on TryHackMe (for free). Please give me your guys' feedback on the machines in the discussions >channel, and once you guys are happy, I'll start creating the daily threads. I plan to complete all of these before >September and start doing CTF challenges. Please don't be afraid to speak up about machines that you think are a waste of >time. I'll be sure to lay down some general ground rules about how to attack the machine (so to learn as much as >possible). Stay consistent!
